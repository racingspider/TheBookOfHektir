      <p>In a Fevered Dream, You've Seen this Place</p>
      <p></hr></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>You've dreamt about this horrid place for months in tormented dreams that came mostly in fragments. Until two weeks ago when the location suddenly dawned on you. In your haste, you grabbed the first two people you could convince and rushed cross country to reach the beckoning ruin.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><ol></p>
      <p><li>Select a primary character and two level 0 characters to accompany</li></p>
      <p><li>Your primary character automatically gets the skill 'Inspired'</li></p>
      <p><li>Pick any 6 tokens to add to the crew</li></p>
      <p></ol></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>At the end of this short quest lies a MAGIC SWORD to add to your adventures. Short, though it may be, deadly encounters are in store.</p>
      <p><hr/></p>
      <p>A short crawlspace under a ruined stone tower leads into the arcane site of your dream. After a hundred feet of crawling, the light dwindles and a split hallway leads deeper into the ruin. Bubbling can be heard from one direction and the sound of something being dragged from the other.</p>
