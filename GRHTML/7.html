      <p></p>
      <p>Tunnel Slugs and Lash Slugs are common in wet, dismal abandoned places. Tunnel Slugs are generally larger than their Lash Slug cousins, but usually less lethal. Lash Slugs tend to have a multitude of stinging, toothed tentacles.</p>

We held our collective breath as it plopped to the floor and remained stationary for a moment. It seemed to have decided we were a worthy meal as it crashed toward us with abandon."</p>
